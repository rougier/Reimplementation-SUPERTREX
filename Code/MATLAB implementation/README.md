This folder contains the scripts provided by the authors and the results generated using them. Minor alterations have been made to test variations of arm lengths and cost of movement.

Use the script ```run_matlab_scripts.m``` to simulate all the task variants.

These results correspond to Figure 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the paper about the re-implementation, which has been submitted to the ReScience journal.
